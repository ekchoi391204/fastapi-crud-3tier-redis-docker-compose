## Brand & Style
The design system is centered on a "developer-friendly utility" aesthetic. It prioritizes clarity, precision, and logical structure to facilitate efficient CRUD operations. The brand personality is professional, reliable, and modern, aiming to evoke a sense of organized control for technical users.

The style utilizes a **Corporate / Modern** approach with high-performance utility influences. It leans into a clean, systematic interface where whitespace is used to separate concerns rather than just for decoration. Visual noise is minimized to ensure that data entry and system status remain the primary focus.

## Colors
The palette is dominated by **Deep Indigo (#4F46E5)** for primary actions and system-critical focus states. This is balanced against a **Soft Slate (#F8FAFC)** background to reduce eye strain during prolonged use.

- **Primary:** Used for the main "Create" button, active navigation, and primary form focus.
- **Secondary:** Slate-600 is used for secondary metadata and icons to maintain a neutral hierarchy.
- **Surface:** Pure white is reserved for high-priority containers like the CRUD table and modal forms.
- **Status:** Standard semantic colors should be used for success (Emerald), warning (Amber), and error (Rose) states, tinted slightly to match the saturation of the Indigo primary.

## Typography
This design system employs **Hanken Grotesk** for its clean, contemporary feel and excellent legibility in density-heavy interfaces. To reinforce the "developer-friendly" aspect, **Geist** is used for labels, metadata, and technical information like IP addresses.

- **Hero Section:** Uses `display-hero` for the greeting to establish immediate context.
- **Data Tables:** Column headers use `label-caps` in a medium slate color to distinguish structure from data. Cell content uses `body-sm`.
- **Footer:** IP info and versioning use `code-sm` to signify technical/system-generated data.

## Layout & Spacing
The layout follows a **Fixed Grid** approach for the central content area to maintain readability of data rows, centered within a fluid viewport.

- **Hero Section:** Spans the full width of the container, providing high-contrast padding (3rem vertical) to separate the greeting from the operational area.
- **Data Table:** Uses a 12-column internal grid. Name spans 5 columns, Gender 2, Age 2, and Actions 3.
- **Responsive Behavior:** On mobile, the 12-column grid collapses to a single column stack. The table transforms into a "card list" view where each CRUD entry is its own white surface.
- **Footer:** Anchored to the bottom of the viewport or content (whichever is taller), featuring a horizontal flex layout for IP metadata.

## Elevation & Depth
The design system uses **Tonal Layers** and **Low-Contrast Outlines** to create depth without relying on heavy shadows, maintaining a "flat-plus" utility look.

- **Level 0 (Background):** Soft Slate (#F8FAFC) - the base canvas.
- **Level 1 (Cards/Table):** White (#FFFFFF) with a 1px solid border (#E2E8F0). This is the primary interactive surface.
- **Level 2 (Dropdowns/Modals):** White with a subtle ambient shadow (0px 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)) to indicate temporary overlay.
- **Interaction:** Hovering over a table row should trigger a slight tonal shift (Slate-50) rather than a shadow change.

## Shapes
A **Rounded** (0.5rem) language is applied across the system to soften the technical nature of the CRUD application, making it feel more like a modern SaaS product.

- **Buttons & Inputs:** 0.5rem (8px) radius.
- **Cards & Data Tables:** 0.75rem (12px) for the outer container to create a distinct framing effect.
- **Tags/Chips:** 1rem (Pill-shaped) for gender indicators or status badges to provide a visual break from the linear table structure.

## Components
- **Buttons:** Primary buttons use a solid Indigo background with white text. Secondary/Ghost buttons use a Slate-100 background or just a Slate-200 border.
- **CRUD Table:** Features a sticky header with a subtle bottom border. Rows have a 48px minimum height for touch-target accessibility.
- **Input Fields:** Use a 1px Slate-200 border that transitions to 2px Indigo on focus. Labels sit 4px above the input.
- **Action Icons:** Use minimalist line icons (20px) for Edit/Delete actions, using Slate-400 as a default and shifting to Indigo (Edit) or Rose (Delete) on hover.
- **Hero Card:** A distinct container with a subtle gradient (Indigo-600 to Indigo-700) or a clean white background with a thick 4px Indigo left-border to denote its importance.
- **Footer Metadata:** Small badges or plain text using the `code-sm` typography, separated by vertical dividers.
